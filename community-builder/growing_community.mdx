Add Members to your community. Members could be the people you may know, and with a simple contact sync you can add them to your communities and they will be invited to join the community.  

Share the link of your community page to grow your community on your social media platforms. Let the community on other channels know that you are building a video based Genuin community to allow your friends and others to join the community who will be entered into your community as a knowledge seeker and will be consuming the feed of short video content you decided in your community for your community member. This gives your audience a trusted feed that is curated by you. 
 
Share links to your loop to grow your subscribers and subscribers will get notified every time you add a new post to the loop. Which gives a way for your community members to keep updated with the content that resonates with their area of interests.
