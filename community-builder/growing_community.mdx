## How to promote your Community?

To grow your community, you must add members. Here are a couple suggestions on how to do that.

1. Start with who you know. You can sync your contacts to easily invite people you know to join your community. Once added, they’ll receive an invitation to become part of your community.
2. Share the link to your community page across social media platforms. Let your followers on other channels know that you’re building a video-based community on Genuin. 

Promoting your Community allows those interested in the topic to join as subscribers and consume the feed of video content you’ve selected. By sharing the link, you’re providing your audience with a trusted feed tailored to the focus of your community. Subscribers will get notified every time you add a new post to the Loop, allowing them to stay updated with the latest content aligned with their interests. 

## How to diversify your content?

Genuin offers a rich variety of content to cater to your diverse interests. Here's how you can ensure a well-rounded and engaging experience.

**Explore Different Communities -** Join various communities that align with your interests, hobbies, or professional pursuits. By diversifying the communities you're part of, you'll discover a broader range of content.

**Try New Topics & Categories -** During onboarding, select a wide range of categories and topics that pique your curiosity. This ensures that our recommendation system can introduce you to a diverse array of content.

**Engage with Different Content Types -** Don't limit yourself to just one type of content. Explore videos, articles, discussions, and other forms of media to enrich your experience and broaden your perspective.

**Stay Open to New Ideas -** Keep an open mind! Be willing to explore content outside your comfort zone. You might discover new interests or gain insights from unexpected sources.

## How to set your posting strategy?

Consistently creating new Communities, Loops and videos can help build a cadence that your audience expects and looks forward to, but it’s not absolutely required for growth.

The number of videos you post each day does not impact your content’s performance. This gives you the flexibility to do what feels right for your content as well as the Communities and Loops that you are a part of. 


**Quality Over Quantity:**
While frequent posting can keep your audience engaged, the quality of your videos is paramount. Focus on creating valuable and engaging content that resonates with your Community rather than simply aiming for daily posts.

**Engagement & Interaction:**
Building a strong connection with your audience is essential for growth as a Community Builder. Regularly engage with your audience by responding to comments through text, voice and/or video, and actively participating in other discussions. Genuine interaction can foster a loyal and engaged community, which is more beneficial in the long run than posting frequency.

**Understanding Your Audience:**
Pay attention to your audience's preferences and behavior. Experiment with different posting frequencies and times to determine what works best for your specific audience. Analyze metrics such as engagement rates, Subscriber growth, Loops & videos created, and overall reach to gauge the effectiveness of your video posting strategy.

**Consistency and Timing:**
While posting every day may not be necessary, maintaining consistency in your posting schedule is important. Consistent posting helps to keep your audience engaged and establishes a sense of reliability. Additionally, consider posting at times when your audience is most active to maximize visibility and engagement.

**Quality Engagement:**
Instead of solely focusing on posting frequency, prioritize quality engagement with your audience. Encourage them to be involved in specific Communities or Loops which will ultimately foster interest and growth.
