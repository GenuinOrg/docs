Loops are like playlists that belong to a community. You can add multiple videos to a loop that are of the same discussion topics that drive engagement and give subscribers content from the area of interest of topics that matters the most to them. 

There are multiple ways to post videos in a loop. You can post it by simply going to a loop from the home feed and clicking on the post button to keep the discussion going or going to the community tab and post a video in a loop.
