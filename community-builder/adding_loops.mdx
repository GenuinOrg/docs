## What are Loops?

Each community has video content that is divided into different Loops. These Loops are similar to playlists. While playlists contain songs, Loops contain video posts. 

There can be multiple Loops within one community. For example, a travel agency  can have a community named “Visit Tulum” and that community can have three Loops called “Villa Rentals,” “Nightlife,” and “Restaurants.” 

Community Builders and Collaborators can add multiple videos to a Loop, organizing content around specific discussion topics or themes. This drives engagement by delivering subscribers curated videos related to the areas of interest that matter most to them.

## How to create a Loop?

1. Go to the Community page and tap “Create a New Loop.”
2. Enter the Loop name and description.
3. Select the desired privacy setting for the Loop.
4. Select post permissions and add the Collaborators who can post content

There are two ways to post videos in a Loop. 

1. Navigate to a specific Loop from the home feed and tap the “Post” button to keep the discussion going. 
2. Go to the Community tab and post a video directly into an existing Loop.
