### How to sign up and login as a Community Builder

After installing the Genuin app, you can sign up as a Community Builder to create your own community around an area of interest you're passionate or knowledgeable about.

Alternatively, you could be invited by a brand to sign up as a Community Builder, granting you access to the brand's communities and exclusive perks tied to those communities.
