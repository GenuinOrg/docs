title: 'Managing multiple communities'

As a Community Builder, oftentimes you will be creating your own communities, and also be invited to otherâ€™s communities to moderate and join. You could manage all that under the Community section where you could see communities where you are a leader which you started, then once you are given access to as a moderator you will be able to see them under moderate and those you joined will be under joined. 

The loops which you subscribe to will also be available to you under the loops tab, and the loops where you are collaborators you will be able to post videos in the loop.
