title: 'Adding Collaborators to your Loops'
---

Collaborators can contribute by posting videos to any Loop(s) to keep the discussion going – One can request this, in which a Moderator you have assigned can approve/deny this, or even yourself as the profile admin. 

Be mindful about adding anyone to be your collaborator in you loops, it may increase content in your loop and may increase moderation work, so make sure the people you add as collaborators are experts you can rely on to contribute when questions are being asked by community members or your loop’s subscribers commenting on the post.
