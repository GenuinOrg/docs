## What is a Collaborator?

Collaborators can contribute videos to any Loop to help drive the discussion. The  Moderator or the Community Builder can regularly review collaboration requests and approve or deny them as needed. This allows you to curate the content within your Loops.

## How to add Collaborators?

Be mindful when adding collaborators to your Loops, as it may increase content moderation workload. While collaborators can drive engagement, itâ€™s important to vet them carefully to maintain the desired quality and focus within your Loops.

Make sure that the people you add as collaborators are experts that you can rely on to contribute high-quality responses to questions being asked by community members or subscribers in the comments section of a post.
