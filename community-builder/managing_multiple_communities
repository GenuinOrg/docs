title: 'Managing Multiple Communities'

## How to manage more than one community?

When you become a Community Builder, you may be invited to moderate additional communities. You can manage multiple communities under the “Communities” section:
    - The communities you started will be listed under “Leader.”
    - The communities you moderate will be listed under “Moderator.”
    - The communities you’ve joined will be listed under “Member.”
    - The Loops you are added to as a collaborator (or subscribe to) will be available under the “Loops” tab.

You can post videos to any Loop where you’re listed as a collaborator.

You cannot post videos to a Loop if you hold the status of subscriber. Subscribers will receive notifications about new posts in the Loop, but cannot post videos.

## Best practices

Here are some tips on how to be the best Community Builder you can be!

### Stay Organized
Keep track of communities where you are a Community Builder, moderator, or member using the “Communities” tab on your user profile.

### Engage Regularly
Engage with other subscribers, and other members of your community by regularly initiating discussions through question prompts, responding to comments through text, audio and/or video, and sharing relevant content.

### Moderate Responsibly
Ensure that you are adhering to specific community guidelines and policies by moderating content effectively. Promptly address any issues, conflicts, or violations to maintain a positive and respectful environment.

### Customize Content
Tailor content and discussions to the specific interests and needs of each individual community. Encourage members to share relevant content and contribute to discussions that align with the community’s focus.

### Promote Engagement
Use polls, surveys, and to encourage active participation and interaction among community members. Highlight member achievements, contributions, and milestones to celebrate community success.
