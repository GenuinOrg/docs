Communities on Genuin are video based. You can start creating your community by clicking on the ‘+’ in the middle of the app menu bar and start your own community. 

When a brand is inviting you to moderate a community, you will be getting a notification via email and or in your app to join as a moderator for the brand's communities and you could start contributing in the brands’ communities.
