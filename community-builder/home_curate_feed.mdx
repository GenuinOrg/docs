title: 'What is the Home page and how can I curate my feed?'
--- 

From the bottom left of the platform, you will be able to access the ‘Home’ tab. This is a central feature of the Genuin platform where you can access not only videos in all the Communities you are a part of, but also Communities you are Subscribed to. 

Our recommendation system suggests videos based on Communities you're part of. We rank videos using a formula considering factors like recency, popularity, user preferences, and contextual relevance to your interests.

### Community Selection:
When you join communities within Genuin, you're essentially telling us what topics you're interested in. We use this information to gather relevant videos for your feed

### Ranking & Sorting:
Videos are ranked using a formula that considers how recent they are, how popular they are (based on views, sparks, and comments), and how relevant they are to your preferences and Community topics.
- Recency: Recent videos get a boost in ranking.
- Popularity: We consider factors like views, sparks, and comments to determine a video's popularity.
- User Preference: We take into account your preferences, such as categories and topics you've selected during onboarding.
- Contextual Relevance: Videos that align with your chosen categories, topics, and communities are given higher priority.

### Filters:
To improve your experience, we apply filters to your video feed. For example, we exclude videos you've recently watched and ignored. We also consider your country for content, but now we're removing that filter to focus more on your interests.
