title: 'Posting schedule and growing your community'
---
 
Creating new Communities, Loops and subsequent videos consistently can help build a cadence that your audience expects and looks forward to, but it’s not absolutely required for growth.

The number of videos you post each day doesn’t impact your content’s performance, so do what feels right for your content and the Communities & Loops you are a part of. 

### Here is what you need to consider:
Quality Over Quantity:
 While frequent posting can keep your audience engaged, the quality of your videos is paramount. Focus on creating valuable and engaging content that resonates with your Community rather than simply aiming for daily posts.

### Engagement & Interaction:
 Building a strong connection with your audience is essential for growth as a Community Builder. Regularly engage with your audience by responding to comments through text, voice and/or video, and actively participating in other discussions. Genuin interaction can foster a loyal and engaged community, which is more beneficial in the long run than sheer posting frequency.

### Understanding Your Audience: 
Pay attention to your audience's preferences and behavior. Experiment with different posting frequencies and timings to determine what works best for your specific audience. Analyze metrics such as engagement rates, Subscriber growth, Loops & videos created, and overall reach to gauge the effectiveness of your video posting strategy.

### Consistency & Timing: 
While posting every day may not be necessary, maintaining consistency in your posting schedule is important. Consistent posting helps to keep your audience engaged and establishes a sense of reliability. Additionally, consider posting at times when your audience is most active to maximize visibility and engagement.

### Quality Engagement: 
Instead of solely focusing on posting frequency, prioritize quality engagement with your audience. Encourage them to be involved in specific Communities or Loops which will ultimately foster interest and growth.
