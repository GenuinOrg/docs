Community Builders are individuals who bring people together around shared topics and interests, fostering engaged communities. Genuin empowers Community Builders to cultivate vibrant communities around their areas of passion and expertise. 

There are two ways to become a Community Builder. 
1. You can be invited by a brand
2. You can request to become a community builder via the brand's community hub. Once your request is accepted by the brand, you gain access to build a  community under the brand by downloading Genuin app. 

Community Builders can be content creators but they are not required to create and post content. Some Community Builders can take on a moderator role and some contribute content as collaborators. 

### How do Community Builders access the Genuin platform?
Community Builders can access the platform via the iOS app, Android app, and web app for free. They can start their own communities or join and build communities on behalf of brands.

## What is a Community Builder?

As a Community Builder, you can create your own Communities aligned with your interests (e.g. cooking, fiction novels, martial arts, dancing). The purpose of becoming a Community Builder is to share knowledge, educate others, and provide entertainment in whatever area you are passionate about. 

Within each Community, you can create multiple Loops (or sub-categories) and designate videos under each Loop to further organize the content.

If you create a Community, you can also add Community members and Collaborators to contribute to any Communities and Loops of your choice to gain more momentum and engagement.

## Why become a Community Builder?

As a Community Builder, you can elevate your personal or professional persona.  By contributing to a specific brand or organization, you can establish yourself as a leader on a specific topic, area, or interest, enabling you to gain more reach and engagement.

## Do Community Builders contribute content?

While a Community Builder can contribute content, the content is primarily provided by Collaborators who can contribute to any Loop. As a Community Builder, you will assign a Moderator to manage who can and cannot contribute content. Collaborators can request permission to contribute content and the Moderator can approve/deny the request. As a Community Builder, you may assign yourself to be the Moderator.

## Can Community Builders serve multiple brands?

Along with being a Community Builder for your own area(s) of interest(s) on your own profile, you also become a Community Builder for additional brands and organizations that captivate your interest.

To be added to either moderate or collaborate in Loops and Communities, as well as join a designated Community, select “Join.” This will allow you to contribute videos to existing Loops as well as new Loops.
