Genuin enables you to manage when a community is public or private. 

Private communities may be used for closed and internal discussions. 
You also have the option to make a community public while keeping specific Loops private. This allows you to drive awareness by sharing public content, while offering exclusive offers and content within private Loops for dedicated community members.
