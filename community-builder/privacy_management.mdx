title: 'Privacy Management'

Genuin enables you to manage when a community is public or private.
Private communities may be used for closed and internal discussions. You also have the option to make a community public while keeping specific Loops private. This allows you to drive awareness by sharing public content, while offering exclusive offers and content within private Loops for dedicated community members.

## Types of Community

    1. Public: Public communities will be viewable, searchable, shareable by anyone across the open web.
    2. Private: Private communities are visible to community members only and if any non-community members view the community through a shared link it will show the lockscreen view of the community.

**Note:** Community Builder can set the restriction on who can create loops to ‘All members’ or ‘Moderators’. (Incase of private community ‘All members’ = Community Members)

## Types of Loop

    1. Public: If the setting of the loop is ‘Who can see’ = ‘Everyone’ then it’s considered as a public loop which is viewable/searchable and shareable by any user.
    2. Private: If the setting of the loop is ‘Who can see’ = ‘Collaborators Only’ then it is considered as a private loop which is visible to collaborators only. 

**Note:** You as a Community Builder can add one more layer on ‘Who can post in a loop’ to maintain the appropriate environment by selecting options like ‘All Community Members’ or ‘Collaborators’ only.
