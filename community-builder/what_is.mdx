title: 'What is a Community Builder?'
---

As a Community Builder, you can create your own Communities that align with your interest (i.e: Cooking, Fiction Novels, Combat Sports, Dancing) for the purpose of sharing, educating, and/or entertaining. Within these Communities, you as a Community Builder can create Loops and designated videos under each one of those Loops. 

As your own Community Creator, you can also add Moderators & Collaborators to contribute to any Communities and Loops of your choice to gain more momentum & traction. 

- Collaborator Role: Collaborators can contribute to any Loop – One can request this, in which a Moderator you have assigned can approve/deny this, or even yourself as the profile admin. 
- Along with being a Community Builder for your own area(s) of interest(s) on your own profile, you also can have the opportunity to join as a Community Builder for other brands and organizations that captivate your interest by assigning you for such a role.
    - You can be added to either moderate or collaborate into one or multiple Loops & Communities, as well as join a designated Community by selecting “Join” where you can contribute videos to existing Loops AND also new Loops.
        - This will elevate your presence further, contribute to that brand or organization as a leader within a specific topic, area, and/or interest, and ultimately have you gain more reach & traction.
