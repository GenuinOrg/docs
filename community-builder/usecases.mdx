- As a Community Builder, you might be passionate about various topics and want to create multiple communities around them. For instance, you could create communities for cooking, photography, fitness, and travel. By managing multiple communities, you can curate specific content for each community, ensuring that members receive relevant and engaging content tailored to their interests.

- Suppose you're managing communities for a sports app, including communities for football, basketball, & cricket. As a Community Builder, you'll engage with members, initiate discussions, and moderate content within each community. Engaging with multiple communities allows you to foster a sense of belonging among members, encourage discussions, and build a vibrant community around each sport.

- Now imagine you're managing communities for a parenting app, including communities for new parents, single parents, and parents of teenagers. As a Community Builder, you moderate discussions, ensure adherence to community guidelines, and maintain a positive environment.

- Letâ€™s do one more. You're part of an emerging platform for artists and creatives - As an invited Community Builder, you can manage communities for selected painters, writers, musicians, and photographers. As a Community Builder, you share relevant resources, and facilitate collaboration opportunities from other members so they can also contribute to the ecosystem.
