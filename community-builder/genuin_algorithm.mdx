## Our Recommendation System

Genuin suggests videos based on the communities you’re part of. We rank videos using a formula considering factors like recency, popularity, user preferences, and contextual relevance to your interests.

## Community Selection

When you join communities within Genuin, you’re telling us which topics you’re interested in. We use this information to gather relevant videos for your feed.

## Ranking &  Sorting

Videos are ranked using a formula that considers how recent they are, how popular they are (based on views, sparks, and comments), and how relevant they are to your preferences and Community topics.
    1. Recency: Recent videos get a boost in ranking.
    2. Popularity: We consider factors like views, sparks, and comments to determine a video’s popularity.
    3. User Preference: We take into account your preferences, such as categories and topics you’ve selected during onboarding.
    4. Contextual Relevance: Videos that align with your chosen categories, topics, and communities are given higher priority.

## Filters

To improve your experience, we apply filters to your video feed. For example, we exclude videos you’ve recently watched and ignored. We also consider your country for content, but now we’re removing that filter to focus more on your interests.
