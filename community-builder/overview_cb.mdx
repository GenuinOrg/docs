## Who is a Community Builder?

Community Builders are individuals who bring people together around shared topics and interests, fostering engaged communities. Genuin empowers Community Builders to cultivate vibrant communities around their areas of passion and expertise.

Community Builders can be content creators but they are not required to create and post content. Some Community Builders can take on a moderator role and some contribute content as collaborators.

## What can you do as a community builder?

As a Community Builder, you can create your own Communities aligned with your interests (e.g. cooking, fiction novels, martial arts, dancing)on Genuin app or under some Brand’s Profile. 
Within each Community, you can create multiple Loops (or sub-categories) and designate videos under each Loop to further organize the content.
If you create a Community, you can also add Community members and Collaborators to contribute to any Communities and Loops of your choice to gain more momentum and engagement.

### Create Community
Communities on Genuin are video-centric. To start building your community, tap the plus (+) icon in the app’s menu bar, and follow the prompts to create your new community.

### Create Loop
Each community has video content that is divided into different Loops. These Loops are similar to playlists. While playlists contain songs, Loops contain video posts.

There can be multiple Loops within one community. For example, a travel agency can have a community named “Visit Tulum” and that community can have three Loops called “Villa Rentals,” “Nightlife,” and “Restaurants”.

Community Builders and Collaborators can add multiple videos to a Loop, organizing content around specific discussion topics or themes. This drives engagement by delivering subscribers curated videos related to the areas of interest that matter most to them.

**How to Create a Loop?**
    1. Go to the Community page and tap “Create a New Loop.”
    2. Enter the Loop name and description.
    3. Select the desired privacy setting for the Loop.
    4. Select post permissions and add the Collaborators who can post content.
    5. Record the video/upload from camera roll --> Click on ‘post’ and your loop is created!
