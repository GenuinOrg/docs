title: 'Genuin Glossary'
---

At Genuin, we do things a bit different than other online communities. The following glossary will help you understand our platform and how you interact with it. 

| **Entity** | **Description** | **Access**|
| -------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| **Brand**  | A Brand in the Genuin ecosystem is a company, organization or an individual that initiates and manages a dedicated Community centered around its products, services, or identity. | Brands can create their own communities or can select Community Builders that create communities under the brand's profile. Can add Moderators, Collaborators to manage their Community and post content. Brands can also control who can access and manage their Community via the Brand Control Center Portal. |
| **Community** | Community refers to a digital space where individuals with shared interests, passions, or goals come together to engage, collaborate, and connect with one another. Within the Genuin platform, a community can encompass various types, such as interest-based communities, professional networks, or brand communities. You can create both public and private communities on Genuin. |  |
| **Community Builder** | A Community Builder is enthusiastic about a topic and brings people together on the same topic and area of interest. A Community Builder can be a Community Builder, Moderator, and a Collaborator. | Community Builders have the ability to create their own communities as well as join other brands’ communities. They can access all the details of the community they have created and manage it via mod tools on the Genuin app… such as adding/deleting moderating requests, creating Loops, adding/deleting Collaborators, and privacy settings of the community. |
| **Community Member** | A Community Member is a person who has joined the community and interacts with the content. | Community Members can browse through all the public content available within the community and interact with it. |
| **Moderator** | A community moderator ensures that the community is safe for all participants. A moderator can be added by the Community Builder or another Moderator of the community. | The Community moderator has access to mod tools on Genuin app from which he/she can assist in moderating user requests, content, and reports within the community.  |
| **Loops** | Loops are like playlists within a community. You can add multiple videos to a Loop, organizing content around specific discussion topics or themes. This drives engagement by delivering subscribers curated videos related to the areas of interest that matter most to them. |  |
| **Collaborator** | A Collaborator helps build the community by posting content. Collaborators can invite more people to participate as collaborators or subscribers. | Collaborators have loop level access (e.g. posting content and adding new collaborators to the Loop.)  |
| **Subscriber** | A subscriber is the loop- level entity who chooses to follow a loop of specific topics they're interested in. | Subscribers can interact and stay up to date with the loop they have subscribed to, request to be the collaborator and view and interact with the public content of the community the loop is part of.  |
