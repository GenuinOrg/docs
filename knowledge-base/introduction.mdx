Genuin allows people to build video-based communities, across the open web. Bridging social media and community, Genuin empowers consumers, creators, and brands, to gain and share knowledge through bite-sized video content, foster discussions, and authentically connect with like-minded individuals via interest-based communities.

What makes Genuin distinct is its open web approach which provides for unique abilities for community builders to grow, understand, and truly connect with their audience on their terms. Genuin communities are distributed on brand partners and community builders’ owned and operated properties; syndicated through publishers relevant to each community; findable through SEO, and are available in Genuin’s own app. Genuin’s open platform makes community a seamless part of the web experience by encouraging link-outs and integration with popular platforms for e-commerce, advertising, reward systems, and more.

- **Build Your Community** - Create “Loops” around topics relevant to the brand.

- **Manage Your Influence** - Gain full visibility and transparency to see trends in the community, access participants, and influence conversations.

- **Market Your Brand** - Distribute the community widely on the open web to directly grow your audiences.
