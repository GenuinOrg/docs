title: 'Android SDK for Brands'
---

Genuin Android SDK comprises features such as brand feed, communities, and loops. When a brand installs SDK on their own app, their fans and customers are able to join communities, request to become collaborators, spark posts that ignites their interests, comment on posts that are interesting to them, share a post, share a loop or share a community link to grow the brandsâ€™ communities across their existing social groups and channels.

Brands integrating Genuin SDK increases attention span for consumers due to its social feed experience which is TikTok like feed that hooks the users to keep on consuming content that is 100% moderated and managed by the Brand.
