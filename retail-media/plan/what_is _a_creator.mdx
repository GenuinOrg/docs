# What is a Creator?

A Creator plays a crucial role in your brand's ecosystem by creating and managing spaces where people can connect and interact. They help to gather content, spark conversations, and keep the community lively and engaged.

## Who Can Be a Creator for Your Brand?

Creators can be anyone who loves your brandâ€”employees, loyal customers, influencers, or partners. For example, if your Retail Media Network focuses on organic food products, a Creator might be someone passionate about healthy living, sharing recipes or meal prep ideas that inspire your audience to engage with and purchase those products.

## What Can They Do?

While Creators do not have special access to Communities, they have the ability to manage Groups. This means they can create and organize content, facilitate discussions, and help keep your Groups aligned with the overall goals of your brand. Defining their role clearly ensures they can actively contribute to building meaningful connections within your ecosystem.
