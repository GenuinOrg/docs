A community is a collaborative space where members with shared interests can connect and engage. For example, you might create a community focused on skincare where members can discuss products, share tips, and watch tutorials.
Once your community is set up, you can invite members to join and contribute. This creates a dynamic environment for discussion and interaction, making it easier to connect with others who share your passion.

To add a Community follow the below steps: 

**1. Log in to the Brand Control Center**
