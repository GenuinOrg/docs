title: 'Example Use Case for Retail Media Networks'
---

While Retail Media Networks (RMNs) are among the hottest and fastest-growing trends in marketing, they also face various challenges that can hinder advertising effectiveness.

Genuin offers innovative tools and features that address these challenges, helping RMNs optimize their operations and achieve better results. Here’s how Genuin can make a difference in real-world scenarios:

#### 1. Uncap Revenue Limitations

-   **Challenge**: RMN "A" faces restricted ad inventory on its site and app, forcing ad dollars to offsite channels through trade media partners. As a result, only 35% of revenue stays in-house, reducing profit margins.
    
-   **With Genuin**: Genuin’s Community Media Network removes these limitations by offering unlimited vertical video scrolling, which increases on-site time, boosts engagement, generates more impressions, and incorporates shoppable videos to drive additional commerce and revenue growth.
    

#### 2. Enhancing Audience Engagement

-   **Challenge**: RMN "B" struggles to connect with its target audience, impacting campaign success.
    
-   **With Genuin**: Genuin enables RMN "B" to gather and organize more engaging content from various sources—including its own social channels, customer partners, creators, influencers, and consumers—into one place. This transforms the platform from simply sending content to becoming a vibrant, two-way community where users can engage, share, and interact more effectively.
    

#### 3. Accelerating Content Creation

-   **Challenge**: RMN “C” experiences delays and quality issues in producing engaging campaign content.
    
-   **With Genuin**: Genuin’s Auto Create feature, powered by GenuAI, automates video and media content production, significantly speeding up the creation process. This ensures consistently high-quality content that’s delivered on time.
    

#### 4. Gaining Real-Time Performance Insights

-   **Challenge**: RMN “D” needs better visibility into campaign performance to make timely adjustments and optimize results.
    
-   **With Genuin**: The platform’s real-time analytics provide up-to-date performance tracking, enabling RMN "D" to make quick, data-driven decisions and refine campaigns based on the latest insights.
    

#### 5. Ensuring Secure Access Control

-   **Challenge**: RMN "E" requires robust, customizable access controls to securely manage team roles and permissions.
    
-   **With Genuin**: The platform offers flexible control settings, allowing RMN "E" to manage access and permissions efficiently, ensuring campaign elements are handled securely and effectively.
    

#### 6. Optimizing Ad Placements

-   **Challenge**: RMN "F" struggles with inefficient ad placement, leading to lower engagement and wasted impressions.
    
-   **With Genuin**: Genuin’s AI-driven ad placement tools analyze user behavior and engagement patterns in real-time, optimizing where and when ads are displayed. This ensures that ads are shown in the most effective spots, maximizing visibility, increasing user interaction, and improving overall ad performance
    

#### 7. Turning Content Into Social Commerce

-   **Challenge**: RMN "G" is struggling to convert content engagement into direct sales and revenue.
    
-   **With Genuin**: Genuin transforms passive content consumption into an active shopping experience with shoppable videos and in-feed product listings. By allowing users to shop directly from video content or community interactions, RMN "G" can drive higher conversion rates, turning engaged users into paying customers and boosting overall revenue through seamless social commerce integration.
