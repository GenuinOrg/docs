title: 'What are Subscribers'
---

Subscribers are individuals who follow to receive updates from a specific group within your platform. Unlike members who are part of a community, subscribers are interested in staying informed about the particular groupâ€™s content, such as new posts or discussions. They might not actively participate but are kept in the group with the latest updates and announcements.

For example, if you have a group dedicated to the latest tech reviews, subscribers will receive notifications or updates whenever new content is added, keeping them engaged with the group's focus.
