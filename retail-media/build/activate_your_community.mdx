Activating your community is about making it come alive and ensuring it's engaging for all members. This involves setting up interactive elements like content and hashtag challenges that encourage participation and foster a lively atmosphere.

#### Content Challenges

Content challenges are activities where community members are invited to create and share their own content based on a specific theme or topic. This can include:

-   Photo or Video Contests: Ask members to share their best photos or videos related to a theme. For example, a fitness community might host a challenge for the best home workout video.
    
-   Creative Challenges: Set up tasks that encourage members to explore new ideas and showcase their talents. For instance, you might ask members to design a logo for a community event or come up with innovative solutions to a common problem. These activities inspire creativity and foster active involvement.

#### Hashtag Challenges

Hashtag challenges involve encouraging members to use a specific hashtag when posting content related to your communityâ€™s theme. This helps track and aggregate content, making it easier to find and engage with:

-   Branded Hashtags: Create unique hashtags for your community and ask members to use them when posting relevant content. For instance, a cooking community might use #HomeChefChallenge to gather all entries.
    
-   Thematic Hashtags: Use hashtags related to particular events or themes within your community. This can help boost visibility and interaction around specific topics.
