## What is an Admin?

An Admin helps maintain the quality and tone of your community by monitoring discussions, enforcing guidelines, and addressing issues. They ensure that the space remains respectful and organized, keeping the community safe and welcoming.

### Difference between Creators and Admins

Unlike Creators, who create and manage community spaces, Admins focus on overseeing interactions within those spaces. They will typically be an employee of your company or trusted resource.

Creators set up and organize content, while Admins ensure discussions follow guidelines, resolve conflicts, and maintain a positive environment.
