## What is a Member?

A Member is someone who actively contributes to your community by creating and managing content within Groups.

While their role may overlap with that of a Creator, the key difference lies in their specific focus on supporting the content and engagement within Groups rather than managing the entire community. Members are often experts, team members, or partners who bring valuable insights, helping to foster ongoing discussions and keep the community engaged.

Unlike Creators, who oversee the entire community, including Groups, Members are more focused on driving activity within individual Groups.

By adding members, you distribute responsibilities and benefit from their unique expertise, helping your community grow and succeed.
