## Integration Methods

Genuin offers two primary integration methods for brands to integrate:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Managed Service Integration">
    **Provide Repository Access:** Grant access to your existing mobile project repository to the Genuin team.
    **Fork Repository:** Genuin will fork the repository and integrate the SDK code into it.
    **QA Check:** Genuin will perform a comprehensive QA check across the app to ensure seamless integration of the SDK.
    **Merge Changes:** Once QA is completed, Genuin will provide the changes back to your repository.
    <Info>
    _* Currently we do not charge for managed service for enterprise customers. Requests are prioritized based on the priority of the customer integration and developerâ€™s availability. We will try to speed up every integration that comes our way._
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Self Service Integration">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
