# Benefits of white label solution

Understand how hosting the community under your domain enhances your brand's online presence and benefits SEO through improved Google indexing.

By adopting the white label solution, your brand's community will be hosted under your own domain (e.g., "community.ted.com"), rather than a subdomain provided by Genuin.

  

How does it help in Google Indexing?

Hosting your community under your own domain can positively impact its visibility on search engines like Google. When all community content resides under your brand's domain, it consolidates the authority and relevance of your website in the eyes of search engines. As a result, your community content is more likely to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs), leading to increased organic traffic and better discoverability for your brand.
