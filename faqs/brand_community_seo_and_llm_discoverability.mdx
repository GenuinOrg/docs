**Introduction**

This document addresses the question of how content in a brand community is discoverable by search engines and Large Language Models (LLMs), and how this process contributes to SEO. It provides information to ensure that brand communities are optimized for both traditional web crawlers and AI-driven discovery.

# Section 1: Brand Communities and Content Discoverability by Search Engines

We follow standard practices for SEO, including optimizing URLs, titles, and descriptions, as well as incorporating relevant keywords.

## 1.1 SEO Attributes for Enhanced Discoverability

The attached sheet details the attributes at the community, group, post, and profile levels that contribute to SEO and greater discoverability by search engines - [SEO : Genuin Page Meta Attributes - Sephora](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13xcU0Vvqq7oAN-ETV7_Z04b6XKB7VcDoGyqeRCMa8VM/edit?usp=sharing)

  


## 1.2 SEO Compatibility and Benchmarking with PageSpeed Insights

[PageSpeed Insights (PSI)](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) results for our community pages highlight strong SEO compatibility. Key metrics such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) are within the optimal ranges, demonstrating that the platform is built with SEO in mind. These results serve as a benchmark and a testament to our commitment to providing an SEO-friendly environment for brand communities.

## 2.2 Offsite Optimization

-   Question: How else can our community content positively impact offsite optimization related to SEO and traffic building?
    
-   Answer: The existing framework supports offsite optimization by facilitating backlinking and social media engagement, aligning with industry standards for enhancing SEO and driving traffic.
    

## 2.3 Technical Aspects for LLM SEO (LEO)

### 2.3.1 Crawlability of Pages

-   Question: Is the content crawlable by LLM?
    
-   Answer: Yes, all six types of pages are crawlable:
    

a) Community Page

b) Group Page

c) Post Page

d) User Profile

e) Brand Profile

f) Subdomain Home Page

  

### 2.3.2 OpenAI Crawlers

OpenAI uses web crawlers ("robots") and user agents to gather data for its products. Webmasters can control how their sites interact with OpenAI by using robots.txt tags. Each setting is independent.

-   Reference:  [OpenAI Official Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/bots)
    
-   Recommendation: The client's webmaster should update the website's robots.txt file according to OpenAI's official documentation. It is recommended to enable crawling for all OpenAI user agents to maximize LLM SEO and discoverability.
    
-   Robots.txt Information: For more information on robots.txt, refer to [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro).
    

  

#### 2.3.2.1 Steps to Configure “robots.txt” for OpenAI:

The following robots.txt directives can be used to manage OpenAI's access to your site:

- 1.  User-agent: Specify the OpenAI user agent (e.g., GPTBot, ChatGPT-User).
    
- 2.  Disallow: Block OpenAI from accessing certain paths or the entire site.
    
- 3.  Allow: Explicitly allow OpenAI to access specific paths.
    

Example robots.txt configuration:

User-agent: *  
Disallow: /private/  
User-agent: GPTBot  
Allow: /

This configuration blocks all user agents from the /private/ directory, but allows the GPTBot to access the rest of the site, where GPTBot will use the data to feed their foundational AI models.

### 2.3.3 Perplexity Crawlers

Perplexity uses web crawlers ("robots") and user agents to collect and index information from the internet. Webmasters can manage how their sites interact with Perplexity using robots.txt tags. Changes may take up to 24 hours to be reflected.

-   Reference:  [Perplexity Official Documentation](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots)
    
-   Recommendation: The client's webmaster should update the website's robots.txt file as per Perplexity's official documentation to ensure optimal LLM SEO and discoverability.
    

#### 2.3.3.1 Steps to Configure robots.txt for Perplexity:

These robots.txt directives can control how Perplexity interacts with your site:

1.  User-agent: Identify Perplexity's user agent (e.g., PerplexityBot).
    
2.  Disallow: Prevent Perplexity from accessing certain URLs or the entire site.
    
3.  Allow: Specifically permit Perplexity to access designated URLs.
    

Example robots.txt for Perplexity:

User-agent: *  
Disallow: /admin/  
User-agent: PerplexityBot  
Allow: /

In this example, all bots are blocked from the /admin/ section, while PerplexityBot is allowed to crawl the rest of the website.

## 2.4 llms.txt File

To provide LLM-friendly content, as per industry standards adding an /llms.txt markdown file to websites. This file offers background information, guidance, and links to detailed markdown files.

-   Reference:  [LLMs-TXT Official Documentation](https://llmstxt.org/)
    
-   Discover websites using llms.txt:  [llms.txt directory](https://directory.llmstxt.cloud/)

-   [LLMs.txt Explained | Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/llms-txt-414d5121bcb3/)
    

  

### 2.4.1 Steps to Implement /llms.txt:

1.  Create the /llms.txt file: Create a new markdown file named llms.txt at the root directory of your website.
    
2.  Add basic information: Include a brief introduction about your website and its purpose.
    
3.  Provide guidance to LLMs: Explain how you would like LLMs to interact with your content (e.g., prioritize certain sections, avoid specific areas).
    
4.  Link to detailed markdown files: If you have more detailed information, create additional markdown files and link to them from /llms.txt. This can include site maps, content guidelines, etc.
    
5.  Publish the file: Ensure the llms.txt file is accessible via a web browser by navigating to yourdomain.com/llms.txt.
    
6.  Maintain the file: Regularly update the file to reflect any changes in your website structure or content strategy.
    

## 2.5 llms-full.txt File

According to ideal practices, adding an /llms-full.txt markdown file to websites is recommended. This file offers detailed background information, comprehensive guidance, and extensive links to markdown files.

-   It should contain all the detailed content in one place, allowing LLMs to access all the information without needing to navigate to multiple pages.
    

2.5.1 Steps to Implement /llms-full.txt:

1.  Create the /llms-full.txt file: Create a new markdown file named llms-full.txt at the root directory of your website.
    
2.  Add detailed basic information: Include an extensive introduction about your website and its purpose, covering all aspects relevant to LLMs.
    
3.  Provide comprehensive guidance to LLMs: Explain in detail how you would like LLMs to interact with your content, including specific instructions for different types of content, sections, and potential issues to avoid.
    
4.  Link to extensive markdown files: Create detailed markdown files with comprehensive information, and link to them from /llms-full.txt. This can include site maps, content guidelines, technical specifications, and any other relevant documentation.
    
5.  Publish the file: Ensure the /llms-full.txt file is accessible via a web browser by navigating to yourdomain.com/llms-full.txt.
    
6.  Maintain the file: Regularly update the file to reflect any changes in your website structure, content strategy, or technical specifications.
    

## 2.6 Submitting /llms.txt and /llms-full.txt to sitemap.xml

While /llms.txt and /llms-full.txt are not traditional web pages meant for direct user consumption, including them in your sitemap can provide clearer guidance to LLMs about the availability and purpose of these files. This can improve LLM discoverability and understanding of your site's content.

### 2.6.1 Steps to Submit /llms.txt and /llms-full.txt to sitemap.xml:

1.  Create or update your sitemap.xml file:
    

-   If you already have a sitemap.xml file, locate it in the root directory of your website.
    
-   If not, create a new XML file named sitemap.xml in the root directory.
    

2.  Add `<url>` entries for /llms.txt and /llms-full.txt:
    

-   Open your sitemap.xml file and add a `<url>` element for each file, similar to how you would for any other page on your site.
    
-   Example:
    

<url>  
<loc>https://yourwebsite.com/llms.txt</loc>  
<lastmod>2024-07-26</lastmod> <changefreq>daily</changefreq>  
<priority>0.8</priority>  
</url>  
<url>  
<loc>https://yourwebsite.com/llms-full.txt</loc>  
<lastmod>2024-07-26</lastmod> <changefreq>daily</changefreq>  
<priority>0.8</priority>  
</url>

  

NOTE:

- a.  Replace “https://yourwebsite.com/llms.txt” and “https://yourwebsite.com/llms-full.txt” with the actual URLs of your files.
    
- b.  The `<lastmod>` tag should contain the date of the last modification of the file.
    
- c.  The <changefreq> tag indicates how often the file is expected to change.
    
- d.  The <priority> tag indicates the relative importance of this URL compared to other URLs on your site.
    

  

3.  Submit your sitemap.xml to search engines:
    

-   Submit the updated sitemap.xml to search consoles through their respective webmaster tools. This process is detailed in Section 2.1.
    

2.7.2 Impact of Submitting /llms.txt and /llms-full.txt:

- e.  Improved Discoverability for LLMs: By including these files in your sitemap, you explicitly inform LLMs about their existence and location. This can help LLMs find and process these files more efficiently.
    
- f.  Better Understanding of your Intent: Including these files in the sitemap signals to LLMs that you consider these files to be an important part of your site's structure and that you want them to be accessed and understood.
    
- g.  Enhanced LLM SEO: While the direct impact on traditional search engine rankings may be minimal, providing clear guidance to LLMs can contribute to a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of your website's content, which may indirectly improve your site's overall LLM SEO (LEO).
    

  

## 2.7 Best Practices

### 2.7.1 Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) involves optimizing content to rank higher in AI-driven search engines that synthesize information from multiple sources.

-   Key Principle: Ensure content is well-structured and engaging to facilitate easy access, interpretation, and prioritization by AI systems.
    
-   Structured Curation: Organize communities and groups logically to aid LLMs and search engines in understanding and navigating the content.
