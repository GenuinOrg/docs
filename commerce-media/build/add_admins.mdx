## What is an Admin?

An Admin is responsible for overseeing interactions within your community, ensuring that discussions remain productive, respectful, and aligned with your brand's guidelines. Admins help maintain a positive and engaging environment by managing content, addressing inappropriate behavior, and encouraging meaningful conversations.

In the context of your Commerce Media Network, adding admin allows you to delegate control and management within your community, ensuring that your advertisers and consumers can engage freely while maintaining the integrity and quality of the interactions.

### Difference between Creators and Admins

Creators create and organize community spaces, setting up content and fostering engagement. Admins oversee interactions within these spaces, ensuring discussions follow guidelines, resolving conflicts, and maintaining a positive environment. While Creators shape the community, Admins manage day-to-day interactions to keep the environment productive and respectful.
