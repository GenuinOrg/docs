1.  **Log in to the Brand Control Center (BCC)**.
    
2.  Navigate to **Settings > Brand Profile**.
    
3.  Customize your profile by uploading your brand image, adding a bio, and entering your preferred URL. Additionally, link your phone number, website, and social media accounts to enhance visibility and connectivity.
