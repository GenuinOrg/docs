title: 'What is a Creator'
---

A Creator is someone responsible for creating and managing collaborative spaces where members can interact and engage with content. They play a key role in shaping the experience within the community by organizing topics, fostering discussions, and driving meaningful connections.

For a Commerce Media Network, Creator helps ensure that brand messaging and engagement align with broader commercial goals.

## Who Can Be a Creator for Your brand?

Creators can be anyone who loves your brand—employees, loyal customers, influencers, or partners. For example, if your brand focuses on sustainable fashion, a Creator might be someone passionate about eco-friendly practices, leading discussions and sharing tips that resonate with your audience.

## What Can They Do?

While Creators in your Commerce Media Network do not have exclusive access to manage the entire community, they play a crucial role in overseeing Groups. This allows them to create and organize content, facilitate discussions, and ensure that Groups stay aligned with your brand’s overarching goals. By clearly defining their role, Creators can actively contribute to fostering meaningful connections and driving engagement within your Commerce Media Network.
