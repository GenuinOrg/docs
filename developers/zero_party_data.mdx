title: 'Zero Party Data'
---

The digital media landscape is increasingly defined by data privacy and personalized experiences. It's critical that brands find a way to understand their audiences and monetize their platforms without compromising user trust. One approach that’s gaining traction is the use of zero-party data: information that customers intentionally and proactively share with a brand. When combined with Genuin’s SDK integrations, zero-party data can power the community ecosystems and unlock media revenue streams - without leaving consumers feeling “creeped out” by invasive tracking or data misuse.

# What is Zero-Party Data?

Zero-party data refers to information that a customer actively and willingly shares with a brand. Unlike first-party data (which is collected through interactions with a customer on websites, apps, or purchases), zero-party data is explicitly provided by the customer, often in the form of preferences, interests, intentions, and feedback.

This type of data is considered highly valuable because it reflects direct insights into a customer's mindset, helping brands understand their audience in a more personalized and transparent way.

Zero-party data differs from traditional data-collection methods in that it places the user firmly in control. Instead of relying on inferred attributes or purchasing behavioral segments from third parties, zero-party data leverages the explicit and implicit permissions that users grant directly to the brand’s ecosystem. These include:

  ## Implicit User Permissions & Signals:
    

1.  Device Information: iDFA (device_id), SHA, UUID, IP Address
    
2.  Client Data: Single Sign-On (SSO), login credentials
    
3.  User-Generated Profile & Interests: Voluntary user profile details (birthdate, social account handles), topics of interest selections to personalize user’s feed.
    
4.  Community Engagement: Which communities or groups users join, which videos, groups, profiles, and pages they view or share, content they “Spark” (aka like), and the searches they perform
    
5.  Content Interactions: Posting videos with linkouts, clicking on linkouts, and reposting videos with added thoughts
    

  ## Explicit User Permissions:
    

Where the brand requests and obtains direct permission from users for sensitive data:

-   Camera Access
    
-   Microphone Access
    
-   Location Data
    
-   Contact Information
    
-   Photo Gallery
    
-   Speech Recognition
    

3.  ## Brand Context Inputs:
    

-   The brand defines assets, categories and topics, personas, and guidelines
    
-   The brand creates communities, groups, posts
    
-   Placements of community embeds also help shape the contextual framework in which content and ads appear

# Connecting Through Genuin’s SDK

Genuin’s SDK integrates seamlessly across multiple platforms:

1.  iOS
    
2.  Android
    
3.  React
    
4.  Web
    
5.  Flutter
    

allowing brands to build and maintain connected experiences across devices. By collecting and analyzing zero-party data within these applications, brands can gain an understanding of user interests, engagement patterns, and community dynamics.

# Personalization Without Overstepping

One question often raised: If the brand doesn’t share additional data with Genuin, how can Genuin enable relevant targeting? The answer lies in the way Genuin processes existing zero-party data and contextual signals:

1.  ## Advertisers gets access to be in communities
    

Sponsored communities, groups and posts. Genuin collects engagement data on content interactions - what users view, spark, or participate in. This helps identify the context of what they are engaging with. For example, if a community and/or group page revolves around a certain topic, advertisers can display ads that are contextually relevant without requiring individual-level personal data.

2.  ## Advertises can show contextually relevant programmatic ads

AdExchange gets context of the ad space from the IAB defined {{macros}} such that the programmatic advertising gets personalised to the end consumers. Custom {{macros}} list (supported by IAB) is as follows. All these are configurable by demand partners and advertisers.
