## Installation

### Standard CocoaPods Install

If your project doesn't have the CocoaPods setup then start with `pod init` which will create the Podfile, else do following changes in the pod file to install GenuinSDK.

<CodeGroup>

```swift Podfile.swift
platform :ios, '15.0'

target 'YourProject' do
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for YourProject

  pod "GenuinSDK", :git => "https://bitbucket.org/genuindev/genuin_sdk_ios.git", :tag => "0.0.4"

end

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '15.0'
      config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
    end
  end
end
```

</CodeGroup>

### Example

Import the BGHome module in your view controller.

<CodeGroup>

```swift ViewController.swift
import GenuinSDK
```

</CodeGroup>

Then you can display the home feed view controller. For example, to use it in your UITabBarController:

<CodeGroup>

```swift ViewController.swift
import UIKit
import GenuinSDK
class TabBarController: UITabBarController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        var configuration = GenuinSDK.Configuration()
        configuration.showSidePanel = false

        GenuinSDK.shared.initialize(appKey: "YOUR_GENUIN_APP_KEY", appSecret: "YOUR_GENUIN_APP_SECRET", configuration: configuration)

        if let homeFeedController = GenuinSDK.shared.getHomeScreen() {
            homeFeedController.tabBarItem = UITabBarItem(title: "Community", image: UIImage(systemName: "person.3"), tag: 0)
            self.viewControllers = [homeFeedController]
        }
    }
}

```

</CodeGroup>
