A community is a collaborative space where members with shared interests can connect and engage. For instance, within your network, you might create a space focused on product discussions where users share experiences, offer insights, and interact with engaging content like tutorials or reviews.

Once your community is set up, you can invite members, such as partners or consumers, to join and contribute. This fosters an interactive environment that enhances engagement, driving meaningful connections across your Commerce Media Network.

To add a Community follow the below steps:  

1.  Log in to the Brand Control Center.
