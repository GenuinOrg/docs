As a Commerce Media Network, first creating a brand profile is vital to establishing your brand’s identity and ensuring consistent communication with your partners and advertisers.

A well-structured brand profile strengthens your network's positioning, fosters trust, and enhances engagement within the broader commerce ecosystem.

To create your brand profile, follow these steps:

1.  **Log in to the Brand Control Center (BCC)**.
    
2.  Navigate to **Settings > Brand Profile**.
    
3.  Customize your profile by uploading your brand image, adding a bio, and entering your preferred URL. Additionally, link your phone number, website, and social media accounts to enhance visibility and connectivity.
