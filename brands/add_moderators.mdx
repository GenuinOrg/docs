## What is a moderator?

### The Role of a Moderator

Moderators help ensure that the community is a safe, positive and engaging  environment for the brand and its community members. Above all, moderators are brand enthusiasts and can post Loops within their Community. 

In addition, moderators can access the administrative aspects of the community such as updating the image/logo, handle, display name, description, categories, social media links, and more.

Your brand can have multiple moderators within each community.
