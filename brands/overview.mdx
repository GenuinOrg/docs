This section will provide everything you need to build your brand’s community. 

The heart of your community is your feed, which is instantly populated with existing content from the social channels that you already manage. Your Genuin-powered brand feed will simply repurpose that content to reach a wider audience. 

Once you have connected your social feeds, Genuin’s GenAI capabilities can help  organize your existing video library into topics and categories. The GenAI tool will make it easy to segment your communities into interest-based Loops.

Our GenAI Engage Engine is available on a managed service basis. Contact us at [sales@begenuin.com](mailto:sales@begenuin.com) to learn more.
