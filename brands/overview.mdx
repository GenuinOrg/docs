You’ve invested significant resources in establishing your brand’s presence on external platforms, but you still don’t have control over vital data regarding content consumption and audience demographics.

Followers on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube represent an audience that you’re essentially renting. You don't truly own these audiences.

Consequently, you may struggle to reach your target audience effectively, leading to wasted time and money on ad campaigns. 

Video-based, controlled communities empower brands to continuously produce tailored content that resonates with your audience. This fosters long-term brand engagement and facilitates the conversion of loyal customers into enthusiastic supporters.

Genuin is a short video-based community platform that can bring you closer to your customers. Our brand-led customer acquisition model is designed to help brands, businesses, and startups of all sizes to focus on video-driven engagement and community building.

The heart of your community is your feed, which is instantly populated with existing content from the social channels that you already manage.

Your Genuin-powered brand feed will simply repurpose that content to reach a wider audience. 

Once you have connected your social feeds, Genuin’s GenAI capabilities can help organize your existing video library into topics and categories. The GenAI tool will make it easy to segment your communities into interest-based Loops.

Our GenAI Engage Engine is available on a managed service basis. Contact us at [sales@begenuin.com](mailto:sales@begenuin.com) to learn more.
