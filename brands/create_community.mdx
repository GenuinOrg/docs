## What is a Community?

In Genuin, your brand can have multiple communities to highlight different aspects of your brand. Each community is a space for brands and community members to discuss a moderated topic. 

You can invite community builders to download the Genuin app and start a community. 

For example, a travel agency brand can have three seperate communities: one for Hottest Destinations, one for Budget Travel, and one for Luxury Travel. Each community would attract different segments of consumers.   

## What is a Community Builder?

As a Community Builder, you can create your own Communities aligned with your interests (e.g. cooking, fiction novels, martial arts, dancing). The purpose of becoming a Community Builder is to share knowledge, educate others, and provide entertainment in whatever area you are passionate about. 

Within each Community, you can create multiple Loops (or sub-categories) and designate videos under each Loop to further organize the content.

If you create a Community, you can also add Community members and Collaborators to contribute to any Communities and Loops of your choice to gain more momentum and engagement. 

### Why become a Community Builder?
As a Community Builder, you can elevate your personal or professional persona.  By contributing to a specific brand or organization, you can establish yourself as a leader on a specific topic, area, or interest, enabling you to gain more reach and engagement. 


### Do Community Builders contribute content?
While a Community Builder can contribute content, the content is primarily provided by Collaborators who can contribute to any Loop. As a Community Builder, you will assign a Moderator to manage who can and cannot contribute content. Collaborators can request permission to contribute content and the Moderator can approve/deny the request. As a Community Builder, you may assign yourself to be the Moderator. 
 
### Can Community Builders serve multiple brands and communities?
Along with being a Community Builder for your own area(s) of interest(s) on your own profile, you also become a Community Builder for additional brands and organizations that captivate your interest.

To be added to either moderate or collaborate in Loops and Communities, as well as join a designated Community, select “Join.” This will allow you to contribute videos to existing Loops as well as new Loops.

## Best practices

### Technical specifications and best practices for your brand communities

As a Community Builder, you can change the image/logo, handle, display name, description, categories, social links, community type, loop creation permissions and community guidelines.

Please fill in as much information as possible.	

To drive members to other resources about your brand, individual communities should include external links to your social media platform and other online destinations specific to that community. To do that, follow these steps:
 
1. Select “Mod Tools” and click “Links.” You will see spaces where you can  include relevant links for LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter as well as a custom URL. 
2. Fill in your social media handles. 
3. For the Community page, click the “About” tab where you will be able to view how everything looks.
