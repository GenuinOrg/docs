## What is a Community for my brand?
Your brand can have multiple Communities which act as individual segments and topics a part of your brand - they act as a space to discuss a moderated topic. For example, a Travel Agency can have a seperate Community for their hottest destinations: Visit Tulum, Visit Mexico City, Visit Bali.

## How can I create a Community for my brand?
Once logged into the app, Select the + icon on the bottom middle of the screen. Here, users can ‘Create A Community’ of choice, and fill in the desired: display picture, Community Name, Community Handle. Privacy settings can also be managed in terms of the ‘Community Type’ & ‘Loop Moderation.’ 
		
## What are the specifications, limitations and best practices for brand communities? 
As a Community Builder, you will have access to Mod tools where you can change the display picture, handle, display name, description, categories, social links, community type, loop creation permissions and community guidelines. It’s recommended to fill in as much information as possible here.	
- Individual communities should definitely have social links and external links specific to that community where it can drive members to other resources, tools, etc. 
    - Select ‘Mod Tools’ and click ‘Links.’ Here relevant links for LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter can be inputted, AND a custom URL. 
        - When on the page for the Community, click the ‘About’ tab. Here, you will be able to view everything.
