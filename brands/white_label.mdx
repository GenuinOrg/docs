## What is whitelabeling?

### What is “whitelabeling” in Genuin?

When you implement whitelabeling your brand's community will be hosted under your own domain (e.g. community.yourbrandname.com). If you choose not to whitelabel, Genuin will appear in the URL as the subdomain (e.g. begenuin.com/community/yourbrandname).

To give your customers a seamless brand experience and optimize your searchability in Google, we recommend whitelabeling your Genuin community. 

## Why whitelable your Community?

### Why white label your brand communities to your own domain? 

There are a few benefits to hosting your community under your domain. Whitelabeling enhances your brand's online presence and positions you as an authority on your area of expertise. 

Hosting your community under your own domain can positively impact its visibility on search engines like Google. When all community content resides under your brand's domain, it consolidates the authority and relevance of your website on search engines. As a result, your community content is more likely to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs), leading to increased organic traffic and better discoverability for your brand.
