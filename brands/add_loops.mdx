## What are Loops?

Each community under your brand has video content that is divided into different Loops. These Loops are similar to playlists. While playlists contain songs, Loops  contain video posts. 

There can be multiple Loops within one community. For example, a travel agency  can have a community named “Visit Tulum” and that community can have three Loops called “Villa Rentals,” “Nightlife,” and “Restaurants.” Each of those Loops will display multiple videos uploaded by Community Builders that are interested in contributing to that Loop. 

## How to create a Loop?

1. Open the Genuin app on your smartphone. At the bottom of your screen,  you will see a set of icons. 
2. Tap the plus (+) button in the center and select “New Community.” 
3. A  new box will appear, prompting you to create your community name, community handle, and purpose. You can also adjust who can see this Loop and other moderation settings.
4. Fill out the fields and select “Publish.” You are now ready to record your first Loop for the Community.
