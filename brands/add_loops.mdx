title: 'Add Loops to your brand communities'
--- 

## What are Loops for my brands’ communities? 
Loops are like a playlist that holds different songs. In this scenario, the playlist is called Loops which holds different video posts. This is all comprised under a Community – There can be multiple Loops within a tailored Community. A Travel Agency can have a Community named “Visit Tulum” and within that, there can be various Loops such as “Villa Rentals” , “Nightlife” , “Restaurants.” Within those Loops, multiple videos can be uploaded through Community Builders that relate to that “playlist.”

## How can I create a Loop and add videos to it?
At the bottom of your device, there is a black banner with off- white icons. In the center, there is a plus button. Tap that, then select “New Community”. A pop-up will showcase that will allow you to create your Community name, Community handle, and purpose. After making any moderation changes and selecting “Publish”, you can record your first Loop for the Community. 
To follow up with other Loops, select the Community where you want to add Loops, then tap the “+” button that states “Create a New Loop”. A pop-up will show, and you can input your Loop Name along with a description. Lastly, you can adjust who can see this Loop and other moderation settings. Tap “Record a post” to post a video. You can post multiple Loops and videos. 

## What are the best practices for arranging Loops for my brand communities?
Desired Loops can be added by Moderators for any given Community. Loops can be arranged in order that is preferred, and the main goal is to further give context about topics, themes, discussion points, objectives, and/or areas through videos which then will be added to those Loops.
