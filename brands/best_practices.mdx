Best Practices For Brands

What types of brands are ideal for community led growth? 
Tech platforms & apps
Brands in the technology sector often have passionate user bases and can benefit from developer communities which can be grown by Community Builders. 
Consumer brands with niche markets
Brands catering to specific interests or hobbies, such as outdoor gear, gaming peripherals, or sustainable products, can foster communities around shared passions.
E-Commerce & DTC brands
Build communities around shared interests or values related to products, which ultimately gains brand loyalty and spreads more reach. Customers can contribute to communities to share reviews/testimonials to build rapport, voice recommendations to help other fellow customers, and overall shopping experience.	
Media and entertainment brands
Companies in the media and entertainment industry, including streaming services, publishing houses, and content creators, can leverage community-led growth through “fan clubs” which act as communities. 
Travel and hospitality apps
Travel agencies, hospitality chains, and booking platforms can create communities around various popular venues, and travel locations. These communities can be fueled by other experienced ‘travel junkies’, and those wanting to gain insight to travel for instance. 
Educating and learning platforms
Brands offering educational resources, courses, or online learning platforms can foster communities of learners, educators, and enthusiasts seeking to share knowledge and collaborate.
Nonprofit and social impact organizations
Nonprofit organizations and social enterprises can build communities of supporters, volunteers, and advocates passionate about their mission and cause about various current and upcoming projects. 
Professional networking and career development platforms
Brands providing career resources, job search platforms, or professional networking opportunities can create communities of professionals in various industries seeking to connect, learn, and advance in their careers.
